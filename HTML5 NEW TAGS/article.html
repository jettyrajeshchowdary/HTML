  <h2>Get Comfortable With Being Uncomfortable</h2>
  <p>
    Stepping outside your comfort zone seriously improves your life.
    
    Humans have an evolutionary need to be challenged—to feel discomfort.
    
    That’s the main revelation of journalist Michael Easter’s The Comfort Crisis, a book about embracing discomfort to “reclaim your wild, happy, healthy self.”
    
    Through his research, Easter discovered that living outside of our comfort zone is good for us, dramatically improving both our health and happiness.
    
    We may not enjoy whatever discomfort we expose ourselves to in the moment—be it a physical, mental, or spiritual hardship—but doing so is key to personal growth and even just plain contentment.
    
    However, if we’re to take that first step outside of our comfort zone, we have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. And we can’t do that unless we master the internal triggers that tend to make us run back to the safety of comfort.
    
    Too Much Comfort Is Bad For You
    Compared to ages past, today’s world is a bona fide utopia for most people living in the industrialized world. Everything we need, and much we don’t need, is at our fingertips: food, soft beds, temperature-controlled shelter. We live in stark contrast to how our ancestors lived for thousands of years, enduring in extreme conditions and hunting and gathering just enough food to survive.
    
    Those thousands of years of struggle imbued us with evolutionary traits that helped us to survive then—but, as Easter argues, make us ill suited for the world of comfort that’s come to be over the past 100 years.
    
    As I write in my book Indistractable, humans are wired to escape pain and thus seek comfort. Through human history, this trait helped us to survive, pushing us to escape cold, stress, and hunger by constantly pursuing warmth, safety, and food.
    
    Yet our instinct to default to comfort works against us in a largely comfortable world, Easter points out. It causes us to miss out on profound human experiences.
    
    We need to now seek discomfort to find the right balance.
    When helicopter parenting started in the 1990s, it marked the beginning of not letting children outside to play unsupervised. They could get hurt! Or kidnapped!
    
    But studies show that helicopter parenting induces anxiety in kids and makes them more prone to anxiety and depression as adults. Children need the essential psychological nutrient of autonomy—to learn how to play with others without an adult moderating, for example—to acclimate to operating outside the comfort zone of their parents’ watchful eye.
    
    Another reason humans aren’t fit for routine comfort: We get bored. An evolutionary characteristic called hedonic adaptation makes humans adjust and adapt to any situation, so we have to always look out for new things to be satisfied. We grow discontent with the same old, same old.
    
    The Comfort Crisis notes a similar human tendency called, “prevalence-induced concept change,” a term coined by David Levari, psychologist at Harvard University. Conducting a series of studies, Levari found that instead of becoming more satisfied as we experience fewer problems, we lower our threshold for what we consider a problem.
    
    We end up with the same number of troubles. Basically, we search for and see problems even when there are none.
    A Little Discomfort Goes a Long Way
    The Comfort Crisis is all about pushing yourself to reach your full potential, to become the person you want to be. Setting goals and challenges for yourself is a form of traction, an action that moves us toward what we want.
    
    Discomfort, then, is good for you—but not too much.
    
    Easter talked with Mark Seery, PhD, psychologist at the University of Buffalo, who conducted a 2,500-person study to explore “toughening,” the theory that too much stress and negativity is harmful, but a little is beneficial. And Seery found that dealing with adversity not only increases our tolerance for it but also improves our perspective on it.
    
    Those in the study who had faced adversity reported higher life satisfaction and fewer psychological and physical symptoms compared to those who’d spent their life sheltered. They also had a more optimistic outlook on obstacles, viewing them as “an exciting opportunity” rather than with dread.
    
    In his experience as the NBA’s top exercise scientist, Dr. Marcus Elliott has also seen that challenging ourselves improves our perspective on failure. “Engaging in an environment where there’s a high probability of failure, even if you execute perfectly, has huge ramifications for helping you lose a fear of failing…and showing you what your potential is,” he told Easter.
    
    And studies show taking risks is healthy for you. The Comfort Crisis cites says certain discomforts protect us from not only physical and psychological problems—obesity, heart disease, depression—but also fundamental issues like a lack of meaning and purpose.
    
    Don’t Let Internal Triggers Limit You
    If being uncomfortable is so good for us, why is it so hard for us to leave our comfort zone? What keeps us tethered to the known so we don’t venture out in to the unknown?
    
    Internal triggers, that’s what.
    
    Internal triggers are negative feelings like boredom, sadness, stress, and self-doubt. They pop up and can prompt distraction from what we’re supposed to be doing.
    
    If you’re attempting a new challenge—running a marathon, starting a job you don’t feel qualified for, traveling solo—those scary internal triggers are likely to be raging.
    
    Rather than letting them derail your grand plan to live out your values and become the person you want to be, you have to master them.
    
    How we deal with uncomfortable internal triggers determines whether we pursue healthful acts of traction or self-defeating distraction. Mastering internal triggers is the first step in learning how to step outside of your comfort zone in order to achieve your goals.
    
    So, here are four steps you can take to disarm internal triggers as you strive to overcome your next challenge:
    
    Step 1: Look for the discomfort that precedes the distraction, homing in on the internal trigger.
    Step 2: Write down the internal trigger.
    Step 3: Explore the negative sensation with curiosity instead of contempt.
    Step 4: Beware of liminal moments.
    To dive more in depth, check out my overview steps for mastering internal triggers.
    
    By opening ourselves up to discomfort—and defusing the internal triggers holding us back—we can evolve into our ideal selves.</p>

  <h2>This is What Most People Get Wrong About Willpower</h2>

  <p>You come home after a long day of work and you immediately curl yourself up on the couch and binge the latest Netflix craze for hours, while you scroll and scroll through your social media feeds and snack on potato chips even though you’re “on a diet.” You look around and see that the garbage needs to be taken out, laundry needs to be folded, and your child’s toys are strewn across the living room floor. The list of productive things you could be doing seem endless, yet you can’t seem to find the willpower to peel yourself off of the couch to do them.

    Is this a regular occurrence for you? Do you realize that you are in this rut but can’t seem to find the willpower to overcome it? You’re definitely not alone in this situation. This is called ego-depletion. Ego-depletion is a theory that willpower is connected to a limited reserve of mental energy, and once you run out of that energy, you’re more likely to lose self-control. This theory would seem to explain your post-work defeat.
    
    But new studies suggest that we’ve been thinking about willpower all wrong, and that the theory of ego-depletion isn’t true. Even worse, holding on to the idea that willpower is a limited resource can actually be bad for you, making you more likely to lose control and act against your better judgment.
    
    Ego-depletion is an idea that makes us less likely to accomplish our goals by providing a rationale to quit when we could otherwise persist.CLICK TO TWEET
    The Real Nature of Willpower
    In a study conducted by Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck and her colleagues, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Dweck concluded that signs of ego depletion were observed only in those test subjects who believed willpower was a limited resource. They studied how people reacted when they were fatigued and told to drink lemonade with sugar in it to give them a boost. After the participants drank the lemonade, the researchers evaluated how they reacted.
    
    It wasn’t the sugar in the lemonade, but the belief in its impact that gave participants an extra boost. People who did not see willpower as a finite resource did not show signs of ego-depletion. If Dweck’s conclusions are correct, that means that ego-depletion is essentially caused by self-defeating thoughts and not by any biological limitation, an idea that makes us less likely to accomplish our goals by providing a rationale to quit when we could otherwise persist.
    
    Michael Inzlicht, a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto and the principal investigator at the Toronto Laboratory for Social Neuroscience, offers an alternative view to Dweck’s conclusions. Inzlicht believes that willpower is not a finite resource but instead acts like an emotion. Just as we don’t “run out” of joy or anger, willpower ebbs and flows based on what’s happening to us and how we feel.
    
    For example, to determine how in control people feel regarding their cravings for cigarettes, drugs, or alcohol, researchers administered a standard survey called the Craving Belief Questionnaire. The assessment is modified for the participant’s drug of choice and presents statements like, “Once the craving starts … I have no control over my behavior,” and the cravings “are stronger than my willpower.”
    
    How people rate these statements tells researchers a great deal, not only about their current state but also how likely they are to remain addicted. Participants who indicate they feel more powerful as time passes increase their odds of quitting. In contrast, studies of cigarette smokers found that those who believed they were powerless to resist were most likely to fall off the wagon after quitting.
    
    The logic isn’t surprising, but the extent of the effect is remarkable. A study published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs found that individuals who believed they were powerless to fight their cravings were much more likely to drink again. The same theory could be applied to other things as well, such as working out, dieting, self-control in a relationship, etc.
    
    A New Decision-Making Tool
    Seeing the link between temperament and willpower through a different lens has profound implications on the way we focus our attention. For one, if mental energy is more like an emotion than fuel in its tank, it can be managed and utilized as such. For example, a toddler might throw a temper tantrum when refused a toy but will, as they age, gain self-control and learned to ride out bad feelings. Similarly, when we need to perform a difficult task, it’s more productive and healthy to believe a lack of motivation is temporary than it is to tell ourselves we’re spent and need a break.
    
    But sometimes a lack of motivation isn’t temporary. Feelings are our bodies’ way of conveying information our conscious minds might miss. When a lack of mental energy is chronic, we should listen to our willpower just as we should listen to our emotions.
    
    The key here is that if we adjust the perspective and treat willpower as an emotion, it could instead be seen as providing insights about what we should and shouldn’t be spending our time on. By listening to our lack of willpower as we would an emotion — as a helpful decision-making assistant working in concert with our logical capabilities — we can find new paths that may not require us to do things we fundamentally don’t want to do.
    
    Feelings are our bodies' way of conveying information our conscious minds might miss.CLICK TO TWEET
    What we say to ourselves is vitally important. Labeling yourself as having poor self-control actually leads to less self-control. Rather than telling ourselves we failed because we’re somehow deficient, we should offer self-compassion by speaking to ourselves with kindness when we experience setbacks.
    
    Rather than quit, we need to understand that we don’t run out of willpower. Believing we do makes us less likely to accomplish our goals, by providing a rationale to quit when we could otherwise persist.

  <h2>The Surprising Benefits of Unconditional Positive Regard</h2>

  <p>In 1967, a catchy tune by The Beatles, “All You Need is Love,” became the anthem for the Summer of Love. The Flower Power culture embraced the song and its message, “love is all you need.” If someone had asked humanistic psychologist Carl Rogers what the song meant, he might have said, “Unconditional Positive Regard!”


    Although it didn’t quite roll off the tongue the same way, Rogers introduced the concept nearly a decade before the Beatles song, it has the same basic message: empathy invokes change.
    
    Rogers emphasized the importance of unconditional positive regard in healthy personality development, and his work has implications beyond the lab or therapist’s office. Treating ourselves and others with unconditional positive regard can improve our lives in many ways.
    
    In this article, we will cover:
    What is unconditional positive regard?
    What is an example of unconditional positive regard?
    How does unconditional positive regard facilitate self-actualization?
    How does unconditional positive regard breed self-confidence?
    How does unconditional positive regard bolster motivation?
    How does unconditional positive regard foster authenticity?
    What is unconditional positive regard?
    Unconditional positive regard is defined by humanistic psychologists to mean expressing empathy, support, and acceptance to someone, regardless of what they say or do.
    
    Unlike other practitioners of his day who offered therapies like behaviorism, which were quick to confront how poor choices hurt us, psychologists like Rogers started by validating their clients’ feelings, withholding judgment, and offering support.
    
    Known as “client-centered therapy,” this treatment emphasizes the healing power of human connection. While Roger’s theory shifted the psychology landscape, it didn’t only benefit therapy seekers.
    
    According to Rogers, problematic behaviors like overeating, drinking too much, and procrastinating aren’t altered with confrontation, judgment, or punishment; they are remedied with compassion, understanding, and acceptance.
    
    In his view, people are wired for self-actualization, or the need to fulfill our potential. However, painful experiences like being bullied, shamed, or judged thwart our growth.
    
    Unconditional positive regard restores hope by showing us we are loved and accepted. From Roger’s lens, when people feel safe, honesty follows. And being honest with ourselves and others is crucial for change.

    What is an example of unconditional positive regard?
    Unconditional positive regard means offering compassion to people even if they have done something wrong. A therapist practicing unconditional positive regard would respond with compassion to a person in treatment who may have gambled away their savings, lied at work, or mistreated a friend. It is striving to respond with understanding rather than contempt for the individual.
    
    However, unconditional positive regard does not mean unconditional acceptance. We should be careful to not enable others to continue to act in harmful ways out of our desire not to hurt their feelings. Rather, having positive regard means treating people as fallible human beings regardless of what they do, even if we don’t like what they’ve done.
    
    Whereas judgment and shame elicit defensiveness, acceptance fosters safety, which invites honesty and self-exploration. It’s offering the sort of grace we wish others would offer us when we fail.

    Let’s say a friend borrowed your new car and brought it back with a dent. Instead of asking, “What on earth happened?” a person-centered therapist would advise you to say, “I see you feel awful. Do you want to tell me what happened?”
    
    In our daily lives, question asking can help us gather information, but in certain tense situations, querying can come across as accusatory and judgmental.
    
    Sometimes it’s hard to withhold our reactions, especially when behavior catches us off guard. For instance, if a co-worker spilled coffee on your laptop, you might be tempted to shout, “Why can’t you be careful?” But in this case, extending unconditional positive regard by saying, “We all make mistakes,” might be a better choice of words.
    
    New parents know it can be stressful to leave their baby with a sitter for the first time. When an anxious mother says, “I’m terrified to leave my baby with a stranger,” the person-centered therapist doesn’t say, “What evidence do you have that your child is unsafe?” Instead, they respond with, “You love your child so much, I can see why you’re worried.” In Roger’s view, providing empathy and acceptance allows people to open up and share more.
    
    Researchers have found unconditional positive regard can benefit us and the people in our lives in many ways.
    
    A 2018 study found that athletes who received unconditional positive regard from their coaches were more motivated to play sports and felt more confident. When adversity cropped up, they rose to the occasion and took on new challenges. Most likely, positive regard sparked their inner enthusiasm and love for the game.
    
    On the contrary, athletes who were criticized were less secure, less motivated, and more likely to burn out. Education researchers also suggest that students who receive unconditional positive regard from their teachers are more motivated to succeed.
    
    The takeaway: unconditional positive regard can spark self-betterment, which can help us lead more meaningful lives. Social scientists also state that using this technique can keep us emotionally fit in several ways.
    
    How does unconditional positive regard facilitate self-actualization?
    According to Rogers, unconditional positive regard helps us reach our highest potential, also known as “self-actualization.” While psychologist Abraham Maslow believed few people are self-actualized, Rogers saw striving towards growth as part of the human condition.
    
    Relationships that encourage openness, creativity, and honesty foster self-actualization by letting us know it’s okay to think, feel, and behave the way we do. Studies show self-actualization can help us solve problems creatively, embrace change, and cultivate deep and meaningful relationships. Self-actualization also ignites our “inner spark,” which helps us pursue our goals, even when obstacles stand in our way.
    How does unconditional positive regard breed self-confidence?
    In 2009, Susan Boyle auditioned for Britain’s Got Talent. The 46-year-old hardly looked like your typical pop star with her untamed curly hair and crooked teeth. Before Boyle sang, the audience sneered at her appearance. But when she belted out “I Dreamed a Dream” from Les Misérables, the judges were stunned.
    
    When reporters asked Boyle about the audience’s initial criticism, she replied: “I know what they were thinking, but why should it matter as long as I can sing? It’s not a beauty contest.” In other words, Boyle didn’t accept their criticism.
    
    In the end, Boyle didn’t win the competition, but she signed with Columbia records. At 47, she turned her hobby into a profession. None of this would have happened if rejection had ruined her confidence.
    
    Sharp words and judgment can shrink our confidence, but unconditional positive regard, for ourselves as well as others, can bring it back. After the audition, one of Boyle’s favorite singers, Elaine Paige, called her a role model and praised Boyle for pursuing her dream.

    How does unconditional positive regard bolster motivation?
    While Rogers considered unconditional positive regard necessary for successful therapy, research suggests it’s beneficial in the workplace as well by increasing motivation.
    
    A 2018 study, published in the British Journal of Management found that employees who received unconditional positive regard from their colleagues felt valued, which enhanced their motivation, job performance, and job satisfaction. These collaborative relationships also cultivated a sense of inclusion, which heightened workplace morale.
    
    When it comes to goal-setting, mindset matters. Let’s say we set out to exercise more, be less distracted, or go to bed on time. At the outset, if we call ourselves “lazy,” or “lacking self-control,” our internal narrative can evoke false beliefs that influence our behaviors by reducing our motivation to change.
    
    When we strive to make changes or meet new goals, research suggests positive self-regard can unleash intrinsic motivation, which is the “desire to do something for its own sake.” Taking on challenges that interest us can make us more motivated and more self-determined.
    
    How does unconditional positive regard foster authenticity?
    Social worker and shame researcher, Dr. Brené Brown says authenticity is “the daily practice of letting go of who we think we’re supposed to be and embracing who we are.” Rogers said authentic people are comfortable with vulnerability and approach others with openness and curiosity. In short, authenticity builds intimacy.

    But frequently, our authentic self is shut down by shame, judgment, and criticism. Perhaps someone once told us we were “too sensitive,” “not talkative enough,” or “too nerdy.” Or maybe we were teased for not following the crowd in some way. These messages convey that it’s not okay to be who we want to be.
    
    As a result, we’re forced to choose between living out our values and feeling rejected (usually by those we need and love most) or changing our views to fit in. Often, we’d rather ignore some aspect of ourselves than feel left out.
    
    When we make choices that don’t line up with our values, we often look back in regret. For instance, we may forgo giving a speech or applying for a promotion because we’re afraid of embarrassment or not being able to live up to expectations on the job. But turning down opportunities that can help us become who we want to be because we’re scared of social rejection, stymies our growth and taints our self-perception.
    
    Insecurity and self-doubt may hinder motivation, but unconditional positive regard can dismantle shame, which helps us stay true to ourselves, even when others doubt us.
    
    Behavior change is identity change.
    If we are to alter the way we act, we need to change the way we see ourselves. Extending ourselves towards unconditional positive regard and self-compassion invites us to live out our values without fear.
    
    It can be easy to associate unconditional positive regard with “feel good” psychotherapy, but as studies show, the practice can bolster self-motivation, confidence, and foster authenticity.
    
    Perhaps we want to run a marathon, write a book proposal, or develop our ability to be indistractable; whatever the aspiration, compassion and acceptance can get us there. It’s all we really need.</p>

    <h2>The Pinky Promise: Stick To It – Or Shed Some Blood</h2>
    <p>A pinky promise is a surefire way to make you do what you say you’ll do.
        People have a long history of breaking promises, to themselves and to others. It’s not lying, per se—rather, it’s a lack of follow-through.
        
        We say we’re going to exercise four times a week, or finish that big project, or finally write that blog post, or whatever. But when it comes down to it, we don’t do it. We get distracted and procrastinate.
        
        Our excuse? “I can’t.”
        
        But the truth is, of course, you can! You just need the right motivation.
        
        For as long as people have been squelching on their commitments, they’ve tried to come up with ways to keep them.
        
        Consider the pinky promise.
        
        This seemingly innocuous children’s pact has a dark past: It’s said to have been used by the Japanese mafia, who would cut off the pinky finger of the person who broke their word.
        
        What are the odds that someone breaks that sort of pinky pact? I’m betting pretty low.
        
        Imagine if you made such a strong commitment in your own life.
        
        What if you told yourself that if you didn’t wake up early and go to the gym, it would cost you a finger? Would you go? Of course you would!
        
        We’ve now established that “I can’t” isn’t a real excuse. If the stakes were high enough, you’d do what you need to do.
        
        So what’s getting in our way?

        Why We Don’t Do What We Say We’re Going to Do
        The root cause of all human behavior is the desire to escape discomfort.
        
        In fact, it’s the number one reason people don’t stick to their goals—because they avoid what’s not enjoyable. They just don’t “feel like it.”
        
        When faced with something we don’t want to do, we are driven to distraction by internal triggers. These are negative feelings, such as uncertainty, fear, loneliness, or boredom.
        
        To do the things we say we’re going to do, we have to learn to manage those internal triggers. That means finding the root cause of the bad feeling.
        
        The next time you find yourself repeatedly distracted during an activity, ask yourself why that is. What is the source of the feeling you’re trying to escape? If you know the real drivers of your behavior, you can take steps to master them instead of letting them master you.
        
        Next, to really step away from distraction, we have to make time for traction—the actions that move us toward what we intend to do.
        
        That means pinpointing your values and setting aside time for the actions that help you become the person you want to become.
        
        The most effective technique for staying on track is timeboxing—planning out periods of time to do what you say you will each day. I even created a free schedule maker that will help you devise your own timeboxed weekly calendar.
        
        Once we know exactly how we want to spend our time, we can focus on fending off the external triggers that pull us to distractions.
        
        External triggers are cues from our environment that tell us what to do next. These can run the gamut from notifications on your smartphone to interruptions from nearby family members or coworkers.
        
        The best way to deal with external triggers that interfere with your timeboxed calendar is to eliminate them. Turn off those pesky notifications on your phone that don’t serve you. If you want time to work uninterrupted, let your colleague or family know to steer clear of you during the time you’ve allotted for it.
        
        Swear a Pinky Promise With Yourself
        Once we learn to manage our internal triggers, make time for traction, and hack back external triggers, we can prevent distraction and stop ourselves from ditching our goals by making a pact—a pinky promise.
        
        In making this pinky pact, we erect a barrier, a consequence to not doing what we say we’re going to.
        
        When I wanted to finish the first draft of my book Indistractable, I swore a pinky promise to my accountability partner that I would pay him $10,000 if I didn’t finish the draft by my deadline. I kept my money and finished writing my book.
        
        It’s important to only enter into such a pact after you’ve done the other three steps first. If you don’t learn how to manage the bad feelings driving you off course before you make your pact, you’ll be more likely to fail.
        
        Be honest with yourself about what consequences would ensure you don’t break a commitment. And if making a promise to yourself isn’t enough, then consider finding yourself an accountability buddy to make sure you follow through. Just be sure your buddy knows not to take an actual pinky finger.</p>
