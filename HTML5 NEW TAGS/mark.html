    <h1> Python Full-Stack Developer</h1>

<p>The answer to 'What is a Python full-stack developer?' is that these are individuals who have expert knowledge of front- and back-end components, allowing them to build an application using Python. They use their knowledge and experience in web development languages, responsive design, performance optimisation and web security for designing accessible, responsive and functional front ends. Their expertise in web frameworks, database management and security enables them to build robust, efficient and scalable back-end systems. After building both components, they use application programming interface integration, authentication and authorisation techniques to combine them into a fully functioning website or application.</p><br><br>
   <p> <mark > 1️⃣▶️ Learn the full-stack technologies</mark> <br><br>
Here are some full-stack technologies you require proficiency <br><br>

Python fundamentals
Start by learning the fundamentals of Python by taking online courses and reading technical blogs or prescribed textbooks. Some basic concepts that you can focus on include: <br><br>

🛬Variables and data types <br><br>
🛬Control structure <br><br>
🛬Functions <br><br>
🛬Modules <br><br>
🛬File handling <br><br>
🛬Exception handling <br><br>
🛬Libraries and packages <br><br>
🛬Documentation <br><br>
After you have completed the basics, you can learn additional topics such as generators, concurrency and parallelism, decorators, testing and debugging. Improve your coding skills with regular practice. Along with coding, ensure that you develop an intuition on how each Python library works, so you can edit and customise them for your needs. After practising with simpler examples, allocate some time to use your skills and understanding of Python to work on real-world datasets. For example, practice data analysis and visualisation using libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib or Plotly. <br><br>
    <mark > 📍⏭️front end technologies</mark> <br><br>
After learning the fundamentals of Python, focus on different front-end technologies. Here are some programming languages you can consider learning: <br><br>

🚅HTML: HTML allows you to manage the structure and content of web pages. <br><br>
🚅CSS: CSS enables you to customise the colours, fonts, positioning and responsiveness of web pages. <br><br>
🚅JavaScript: JavaScript allows you to add interactivity and dynamic behaviour on web pages. <br><br>
After this, learn front-end frameworks such as React, Vue.js or Angular to build complex interfaces, increase application performance, promote code reusability and improve scalability. Once you know and understand these frameworks, consider building a personal site, a prototype of an e-commerce website or a related project. Additionally, consider enhancing your knowledge of user psychology, including topics such as cognitive load, visual hierarchy, Hick's law, Fitt's law and emotional design. This helps you design websites and applications that are responsive, accessible, innovative and human-centric. <br><br>
   <mark>📍⏭️ Back-end development</mark> <br><br>
After learning front-end development, begin with back-end development to handle the back-end component of websites and applications. Here are some back-end programming languages and frameworks for you to consider learning: <br><br>

(✿◕‿◕✿)📶PHP: PHP is a popular language for back-end systems and has frameworks that provide pre-built components, libraries and architectural patterns to facilitate rapid development. <br><br>
(✿◕‿◕✿)📶Ruby: Ruby is a programming language that allows for rapid development and scalability and provides features including database abstraction, scaffolding, security and session management. <br><br>
(✿◕‿◕✿)📶Django: Django is a Python framework that provides various features to develop the back end for web applications, including database interaction, built-in user authentication, URL routing and form handling. <br><br>
(✿◕‿◕✿)📶Flask: Flask is a Python web framework that focuses on ease of use, scalability and flexibility, and you use it primarily for small-scale projects. <br><br>


      <mark> 📍 ⏭️Database systems</mark> <br><br>
Continue learning back-end development by strengthening your knowledge of database systems. Start by learning relational database systems and get an overview of basic operations, such as read, join, merge, update and delete. Also, consider learning NoSQL databases to help you make your web application or website more scalable, flexible and available. In-depth knowledge of different database systems can be a valuable skill for you to possess. <br><br>
   <mark>📍⏭️ Version control</mark> <br><br>
Version control allows you to track changes you make to code, files and other components. Version control tools help developers add, edit, update or delete parts of the same code independently. They can then collaborate to merge their code to the main branch, ensuring that the codebase is current. The tools also enable developers to roll back their changes to an older version if there are unwanted changes, errors or inconsistencies. <br><br>

Strengthen your version control skills by understanding basic concepts such as repositories, commits, branches and merges. After learning the basics, make it a habit to use version control in your daily development activities. Make sure to revise your codebase with updated files and code changes, leaving detailed commit messages that explain the purpose of the changes. <br><br>

        <mark>📍⏭️cloud technologies</mark> <br><br>
Many companies have switched to cloud technologies from on-premise systems for development, storage and deployment purposes. Being familiar with different cloud vendors and their core services, deployment models and management tools can provide you with a competitive advantage during interviews. Having practical experience in containerisation, configuration management, monitoring and logging can also be beneficial. If you are self-studying, consider availing free credits from different vendors to practice developing and deploying simple web applications.</p><br><br><br><br>
     <mark> 2️⃣▶️ Pursue certification courses</mark> <br><br>
Full-stack development certification courses usually comprise detailed learning material, quizzes, coding exercises and doubt clearance sessions to help you progress from the basics to the advanced levels. Getting certified can help you strengthen your Python fundamentals, improve your coding skills, learn new frameworks and techniques, and interact with other participants in solving problems. Here are some courses to consider taking: <br><br>
<br><br>
o(≧∀≦)o↘️ Full-Stack Web Development Program – CareerFoundry <br><br>
o(≧∀≦)o↘️ Project-Based Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp – KnowledgeHut <br><br>
o(≧∀≦)o↘️ Full-stack Web Development MERN Stack Training Program – The Hacking School. <br><br><br><br>
       <mark> 3️⃣▶️ Prepare your resume</mark><br><br>
When applying for work, carefully review the job description to identify core skills, experiences and qualifications a position requires. Include only those that align with your skill set, experience and credentials. Add your contact details at the top of your resume. Write a professional summary below it to highlight your core skillsand notable accomplishments to make it easier for a hiring manager to get a quick overview of you. List your job experience in reverse chronological order. When listing your achievements, use strong action verbs and quantify the results to add more credibility. <br><br>
For example, you might mention how you implemented scalable solutions that improved system performance by 25%. Then, add your technical and below the experience section. For example, you can mention your proficiency in Python, front- and back-end technologies, database management and version control as your technical skills. Include soft skills such as communication, team management and public speaking. If you have a portfolio of past projects, technical blogs and other educational material, include that in the resume by adding a link or a QR code that a hiring manager can easily visit. <br><br><br><br><br>


     <mark>  4️⃣▶️ Network with others</mark><br><br>
As a full-stack developer, attending workshops, training programmes and industry events can help you interact with other engineers, IT managers and experts, allowing you to learn about recent developments in the field, upcoming coding events and other essential details during these programmes. Follow experts' repositories to learn about their current projects and any new algorithms, tools or techniques they used. Networking can also help you learn about job openings and get recommendations or references to aid your job search. <br><br>
